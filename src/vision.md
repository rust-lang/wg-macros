# ðŸ”® The vision

## What is this

This document is a collaborative effort to build a shared vision for Macros in Rust. **Our goal is to engage the entire community in a collective act of the imagination:** how can we make the end-to-end experience of using macros a *joyful* one?

## ðŸš§ Under construction! Help needed! ðŸš§

The first version of this document is not yet complete, and we are working on it! We are in the process of understanding what we want to do as a working group, so if you want help please reach out.

## Involving the whole community

The macros vision document provides a forum where the rust community can plan a great overall experience for users.
