# 🙋‍♀️ Cast of characters

## What is this?

We've created four characters that we use to guide our thinking. These characters are the protagonists of our [status quo] and [shiny future] stories, and they help us to think about the different kinds of priorities and expectations that people bring to Async Rust. Having names and personalities also makes the stories more fun and approachable.
